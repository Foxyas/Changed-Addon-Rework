## 💡 Looking for Help to "Un-MCreator" and Clean Up the Project!

My mod has come a long way — and now it's time to take things to the next level by improving the codebase and leaving old limitations behind.

A large part of the mod still contains remnants of its early development in **MCreator**, including redundant code, auto-generated structures, and a few messy design decisions.

### 🛠️ What Does "Un-MCreator" Mean?

We're aiming to:

- 🧹 **Remove all unnecessary auto-generated MCreator code** that clutters the project.
- 🧠 **Refactor classes and systems** for clarity, readability, and proper separation of concerns.
- 🪓 **Eliminate redundancy** and unused or poorly implemented logic.
- 📦 **Unify registries and initialization logic** using proper Forge/NeoForge standards.
- 📚 **Improve code documentation** to make the project more contributor-friendly.
- ⚙️ **Enhance performance and modularity**, making systems more reusable and less coupled.

### 🤝 How You Can Help

I'm currently looking for:

- Developers experienced with **Minecraft Forge/NeoForge** (especially for versions 1.18.2 to 1.21.1).
- Contributors passionate about **code cleanup and refactoring**.
- Anyone interested in **learning real-world mod structure** and best practices through hands-on experience!

If you enjoy cleaning up spaghetti code, optimizing structure, and turning chaos into maintainable systems — you're more than welcome to join the effort!

Feel free to fork the repo, open PRs, or reach out with suggestions and improvements.
